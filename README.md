The top has a battery indicator, a connection indicator, and a reminder of the 2016 US presidential election.

Then three rows with text downloaded from a specified web page (used a simple way for other tools of mine to report to the watch: in this case one can see the utilization of the Yale High Performance Computing cluster and the temperature and humidity in my home).

Then the time and date on the right; heart rate (with a graph), sleep, and walking stats on the left.

Then local weather data, humidity, temperature, apparent temperature, and precipitation prediction (including a graph for the next hour).
